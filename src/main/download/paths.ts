 * Creating it is the point. A download's bytes go to part files and only reach
 * the destination at reassembly, so merely *checking* that a name is free
 * leaves it free: two downloads of the same file name started minutes apart
 * would both pick it, and the one that finished second would overwrite the
 * first — or, if their assemblies overlapped, both would write into one file
 * and neither would survive. An exclusive create is what makes the name ours.
 *
 * The caller owns the placeholder from here: it must be removed if the
 * download doesn't end up producing a file.
