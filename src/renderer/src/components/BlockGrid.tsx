// The grid is a byte-space map of the file: one square per chunk, running left-to-right,
// top-to-bottom. Each square is drawn in exactly one network's color — a square reads as one
// network's work, never as a gradient. Which network that is comes from per-network byte tallies
// (see describeBlocks), so the winner is whoever truly moved the most bytes there, including when
// a chunk changed hands mid-flight after a dropped connection or a pause/resume. Hovering reads
// out the exact split.
//
// Vocabulary is the same as the streams table's: a *chunk* is one real 8 MB unit the downloader
// actually fetches (what NetworkRow labels "Chunk #N"), and every chunk gets its own square. No
// grouping, no averaging — square #7 is chunk #7, so a hovered square points at exactly the work
// one stream did and the two views can be read against each other directly.
//
// A big file therefore makes a tall grid rather than a coarser one. Past MAX_VISIBLE_ROWS the
// grid scrolls instead of growing without bound or shrinking its squares: keeping the squares at
// a fixed size is what keeps them the same unit of meaning on every download, and the scroll
// height is what a multi-gigabyte file's chunk count honestly looks like.
